Magic

It is the power of life, the foundation of matter, and the force guiding all creation.

Magic is life. It is the power that awakanes all living things. All beings breath magic with their souls, in the same way they breath oxygen with their bodies. That allows them to remain alive within the worlds.

Magic is matter. It is the force connecting all matter, to its most primordial particles, and keeping it together. It defines both the space and the border of all things in existance.

Magic is the Guiding Force of all Creation. It flows through all universes, all their parralel dimensions and all the things that exist within them. It is pure energy, both nessecary and sufficient for existence. No creature determines its course or path, and like the stars and galaxies, it just is. 

Like every other force in existance, magic can be studied and manipulated. Humans have tried to do both since the begining of their civilization. But, throughout their 10000 years of research, their understanding is still incomplete. Research on magic is still ongoing, and even to this late age, with all their intelligence, knowledge and technological advancements, there are still more questions than answers about magic, its nature and usage. And even now, every new discovery brings more questions than those it answers. Even the proudest and most arrogant of the researchers do not doubt that human knowledge of magic is still in its infancy. This is the search to uncover the secrets of the universe and its creation, and it is not a matter that can be understood with a mere 10 or 20 thousand years of research.

But here is what we, humans, have found out. Our history of the Creation, its forces, and how we understand it:

There is a Core. The Core of all magic. Its source. How it was created, we do not know. But it exists. Imagine the light of a hundred billion suns, shining upon your head, and that brilliance and power still fades in comparison to the Core. No life can exist close to it. It is too powerful. This is not strange. A tree cannot survive without the sun. But if it gets too close to the sun, it will be eradicated by its heat and power. It is the same with the Core. 

The Core contains all. The memories of all beings, living and dead, the shape of all things, and even the history of all existance, since its begining. Obviously, nothing can control the Core. No being, Man, Demon or God can succeed to such a task. But we understand its processes, or at least some of them.

Magic flows from the Core. It flows in a circle. It begins from the Core, and it ends there. How, we do not know. It flows continuously, like light from a sun. Around the Core, Multiverses move. There are many, however all but our own are inaccessible to us. We know they exist, because we see the flanctuations on magic as they pass close to our Multiverse, from time to time. We have mapped some of their movements, but it is a hard task, and we still do not know how many there are. But magic flows around them and through them. They would seem like fish in the water, whose body is also comprised of water.

On our own Multiverse, we know more. Our (and we assume every) Multiverse is compromised by many Universes bounds next to each other. Magic flows through them, covering their every inch. Every Universe looks like a Sphere. It is difficult to travel to them, but there have been creatures that have come from other universes to us. Some have been intelligent, and some have been not. Some have been tame or kind, and some have been not. And some have looked like creatures of this world -even humans- so much, that we would not know them from our own, but some have looked so otherworldly that they drove people mad by the mere sighting of them. It is dangerous to deal with creatures from other Universes. Dangerous but rewarding, for every such visit is followed by great discoveries and progress, through the knowledge gained from those creatures. But it is very dangerous to creatures coming from the other side as well, for life across universes does not follow the same rules, and the density of magic varies greatly between our world and theirs. So, many creatures have arrived to our Universe only to find death, and not a few all-risking researchers have been lost in the same way, attempting the journey to other Universes.

Our own Universe has been researched far more. We know it is comprised of dimensional packs, stack next to each other. Parallel dimensions, as the public calls them, but in Academia, they are known as dimensional pockets, or as "the space between spaces", if reffered collectively to all pockets but our own. We know for a fact that life follows the same rules, and the density of magic is pretty much normal to us, so travelling there is safer, but still not completely safe. Those worlds are almost the same as ours, but their people aren't. Their history might be extremely different from our own, but even if it isn't, small differences can bring great changes. Above everything else, the journey, and the forces one experiences during it, can drive someone completely mad, if his will isn't stronger than steel. This, however, applies only to those who attempt the journey willingly. If someone happens to fall on a breach through the dimensional wall that has occured naturally, he or she will experience no such forces. This is known as "The Traveller's Paradox". These natural breaches do not happen often, do not happen close to each other or more that a few times. They give no sign of their approach, and they stop equally as abruptly. If someone falls through one accidentally and lands somewhere without dying, if he does not move, soon he will be taken back to his world unharmed, if he so wishes. That is also the result of magic, and how it interacts with the living (see below). These breaches happen when the dimensional wall is weakened, and although dangerous, a careful traveller has little to fear. Most usually the greatest danger comes from creatures that cross to our world and are hostile. They also never happen close to a large number of living beings. Breaches connecting Universes are far rarer, far bigger and far more dangerous, but they give signs months earlier, allowing for preparations that save lives and minimize damage.

There are several ancient scriptures about creatures capable of easily travelling across dimensions, or perhaps even Universes, but none has visited us openly in recent history. Why they visited us, and why they no longer visit us openly is something only those creatures can answer. The scriptures call them by many names: Demons, Devils, Angels, Spirits, Gods, and sometimes they refered to themselves as "creatures of higher dimensions". This is the name used for them today.

This is our knowledge of how the world is built. These are not theories, but facts that have been tested and proven again and again, and none doubts them now. For every question left unanswered by the analysis above, there exist many theories, and most of them are supported by facts, but they are yet unproven.

This is the result of our reseach on the origins of magic, and the Creation and structure of the World. Here follow the results of our research on magic, its essence and its connections to life and matter.

The Soul of a living creature is what keeps it alive. It is the so called spark of life. To sustain the spark, a living being needs magic. That magic he takes from the magic that flows around and through him. That does not decrease magic in the slightest, in the same way that breating does not reduce air. As he takes in and releases magic continuously, the magic sustains him and takes on his nature. His thoughts, desires and dreams, his actions and interactions, his knowledge, everything is imprinted on the magic he releases. Of course, that is but a drop in the ocean, and as soon as the magic he released is mixed back into the great flow, it becomes untraceable. Close to that living being though, the release of magic can be measured or sensed. We call that release aura, but people have called things like presence amd bearing. The end result is the same. It is what allows those sensitive enough to sense that another being is close, and its current state. There is a simple spell can read another beings aura, and others that allows tracking a specific aura or searching for aura(s). We know for a fact that as people grow older, and thus closer to natural death, the strength of their aura grows smaller. When someone dies from natural causes, their aura fades away completely. So the strength of an aura is an indicator for longetivity. The fact is, that as the soul grows smaller, the person grows weaker and his death approaches. Upon this knowledge healing spells work, by infusing a soul with more magic to help the soul, the spark, return to its normal size. If someone is injured from external damage, his soul and his aura reduce in size abdurptly, by an amount equivalent to the damage revieved, and magic around him is infused with his feelings for a large area, hundreds of times greater that his normal aura, as if a part of his soul broke off and fell into the great flow.

As said above, a living being takes in and releases magic continuously, forming what we call an aura. The aura is magic still, but is imprinted with that being's soul in great concentrations. Naturally, the lower the density of magic is in an area, the wider the range of the aura, and the easier it is to sense and measure it. The point is, magic caries out fine fragments from a being's soul as it is released, and is infused by it. Those fragments carry a copy from a part of a person's memories, feelings and desires, a part of his existance, that is. When that is assimilated back in the great flow, they are combined with the fragments of every other creature in that pocket, then Universe, then Multiverse, before returning to be deposited to the Core, which sends out the magic purified once again. During normal absoption, the soul only takes in pure magic, without any fragments whatsoever. There is ongoing research on if and how we can see those fragments from within the great flow, which will allow us to see the memories of creatures beyond our world, and the first results are encouraging. On the other hand, to control magic, magicians absorb it into their soul, while holding specific thoughts, feelings and memories, to infuse it with particular fragments.

To properly research and control magic, we needed to quantify it. Magic is pure energy, but to take form usable by us, and to be infused, a certain amount is required. That amount also represents the minimum we can measure, and the measure itself. We call it "wish". A wish is a small amount of magic, the smallest amount that can be infused with a specific thought, feeling or memory. Wishes are combined to create spells, that are then launched as a magician projects his aura to the target by bending his soul through willpower alone. When an amount of wishes is absorbed, it is already part of the great flow, and thus carries a great amount of fragments from various creatures mixed. When the wizard infuses them, he also absorbs those fragments in the process, or the magic leaves them in him, as it takes his own. The end result is the same, the magician's character changes by those fragments. This is known as madness. Some changes are lost when his soul restores equalibrium as time passes and he does not use more magic. But if a lot of fragments burden his soul, in a short time, those changes start to become apparent, affecting his personality (the character map). A magician can accelerate the release of those fragments, by reaffirming his personality. Meditation, prayer as well as more "worldly" activities like hobbies, talking with friends or the favorite of most, sex are but a few of the tricks a magician has available. Also, the greater the amount of wishes in a spell, the more magic must a magician absorb, which increases madness, and the more must he bend his soul to cast it, increasing the damage his body takes. A begginer spell consists of about 100 wishes, a small of 300, a middle-level spell consists of about 500, a large spell of 700, and a great spell of about 1000. The amount of wishes a magician can absorb (and thus the class of spells he can cast) is determined by his strength of will (see mechanics below). Spells of class higher that great (eg epic, legendary, divine, etc) require a great amount of magicians to cast, and it is not unlikely that most of them will be killed by the casting. The most powerful known spells in existance consist of about 20000 wishes, but ancient scriptures mention spells that beings of higher dimensions could cast, and the most powerful among them are estimated at more than 1 million wishes. Finally, the amount of wishes indicates how much time a spell requires to be completed.

And so we have studied magic and learned how it is connected to us and we are connected to it. And we have been manipulating it for a long time.



             Magic Mechanics Analysis

All mages have strong will. It is the only prerequisite to become a mage.
Thus, in their character map: Strongwilled-Vunderable, they have a value -5 or lower.

Casting Spells
{max number of wishes a mage can absorb: 
Strongwilled-Vunderable value*(-100), if value is positive, he cannot use magic}
{spell preperation time: equal to number of wishes * 10. Rationale is that a magician needs about 1" to 2" for every 100 wishes. Execution time determined by spell}

Madness
It is the price mages must pay to use magic. If they are not careful, and they push their soul beyond the limits, their soul is shattered. Within extreme pain and suffering, the mage will lose control of magic, go berserk and die.

In Game Mechanics terms, every spell cast alters the mage's character map toward its closest extremes, with the exception of the Strongwilled-Vunderable value, that always increases towards Vunderable. The amount by which each value changes, and what values change exactly depend completely on the amount of wishes and type of the spell cast.

Simple spells cannot alter the Strongwilled-Vunderable value, but using a lot of spells in succession within a short time can.

If the Strongwilled-Vunderable value reaches 10 (completely Vunderable), the mage dies from Madness.

Magic

It is the power of life, the foundation of matter, and the force guiding all creation.

Magic is life. It is the power that awakanes all living things. All beings breath magic with their souls, in the same way they breath oxygen with their bodies. That allows them to remain alive within the worlds.

Magic is matter. It is the force connecting all matter, to its most primordial particles, and keeping it together. It defines both the space and the border of all things in existance.

Magic is the Guiding Force of all Creation. It flows through all universes, all their parralel dimensions and all the things that exist within them. It is pure energy, both nessecary and sufficient for existence. No creature determines its course or path, and like the stars and galaxies, it just is. 

Like every other force in existance, magic can be studied and manipulated. Humans have tried to do both since the begining of their civilization. But, throughout their 10000 years of research, their understanding is still incomplete. Research on magic is still ongoing, and even to this late age, with all their intelligence, knowledge and technological advancements, there are still more questions than answers about magic, its nature and usage. And even now, every new discovery brings more questions than those it answers. Even the proudest and most arrogant of the researchers do not doubt that human knowledge of magic is still in its infancy. This is the search to uncover the secrets of the universe and its creation, and it is not a matter that can be understood with a mere 10 or 20 thousand years of research.

But here is what we, humans, have found out. Our history of the Creation, its forces, and how we understand it:

There is a Core. The Core of all magic. Its source. How it was created, we do not know. But it exists. Imagine the light of a hundred billion suns, shining upon your head, and that brilliance and power still fades in comparison to the Core. No life can exist close to it. It is too powerful. This is not strange. A tree cannot survive without the sun. But if it gets too close to the sun, it will be eradicated by its heat and power. It is the same with the Core. 

The Core contains all. The memories of all beings, living and dead, the shape of all things, and even the history of all existance, since its begining. Obviously, nothing can control the Core. No being, Man, Demon or God can succeed to such a task. But we understand its processes, or at least some of them.

Magic flows from the Core. It flows in a circle. It begins from the Core, and it ends there. How, we do not know. It flows continuously, like light from a sun. Around the Core, Multiverses move. There are many, however all but our own are inaccessible to us. We know they exist, because we see the flanctuations on magic as they pass close to our Multiverse, from time to time. We have mapped some of their movements, but it is a hard task, and we still do not know how many there are. But magic flows around them and through them. They would seem like fish in the water, whose body is also comprised of water.

On our own Multiverse, we know more. Our (and we assume every) Multiverse is compromised by many Universes bounds next to each other. Magic flows through them, covering their every inch. Every Universe looks like a Sphere. It is difficult to travel to them, but there have been creatures that have come from other universes to us. Some have been intelligent, and some have been not. Some have been tame or kind, and some have been not. And some have looked like creatures of this world -even humans- so much, that we would not know them from our own, but some have looked so otherworldly that they drove people mad by the mere sighting of them. It is dangerous to deal with creatures from other Universes. Dangerous but rewarding, for every such visit is followed by great discoveries and progress, through the knowledge gained from those creatures. But it is very dangerous to creatures coming from the other side as well, for life across universes does not follow the same rules, and the density of magic varies greatly between our world and theirs. So, many creatures have arrived to our Universe only to find death, and not a few all-risking researchers have been lost in the same way, attempting the journey to other Universes.

Our own Universe has been researched far more. We know it is comprised of dimensional packs, stack next to each other. Parallel dimensions, as the public calls them, but in Academia, they are known as dimensional pockets, or as "the space between spaces", if reffered collectively to all pockets but our own. We know for a fact that life follows the same rules, and the density of magic is pretty much normal to us, so travelling there is safer, but still not completely safe. Those worlds are almost the same as ours, but their people aren't. Their history might be extremely different from our own, but even if it isn't, small differences can bring great changes. Above everything else, the journey, and the forces one experiences during it, can drive someone completely mad, if his will isn't stronger than steel. This, however, applies only to those who attempt the journey willingly. If someone happens to fall on a breach through the dimensional wall that has occured naturally, he or she will experience no such forces. This is known as "The Traveller's Paradox". These natural breaches do not happen often, do not happen close to each other or more that a few times. They give no sign of their approach, and they stop equally as abruptly. If someone falls through one accidentally and lands somewhere without dying, if he does not move, soon he will be taken back to his world unharmed, if he so wishes. That is also the result of magic, and how it interacts with the living (see below). These breaches happen when the dimensional wall is weakened, and although dangerous, a careful traveller has little to fear. Most usually the greatest danger comes from creatures that cross to our world and are hostile. They also never happen close to a large number of living beings. Breaches connecting Universes are far rarer, far bigger and far more dangerous, but they give signs months earlier, allowing for preparations that save lives and minimize damage.

There are several ancient scriptures about creatures capable of easily travelling across dimensions, or perhaps even Universes, but none has visited us openly in recent history. Why they visited us, and why they no longer visit us openly is something only those creatures can answer. The scriptures call them by many names: Demons, Devils, Angels, Spirits, Gods, and sometimes they refered to themselves as "creatures of higher dimensions". This is the name used for them today.

This is our knowledge of how the world is built. These are not theories, but facts that have been tested and proven again and again, and none doubts them now. For every question left unanswered by the analysis above, there exist many theories, and most of them are supported by facts, but they are yet unproven.

This is the result of our reseach on magic and its origins, and the Creation. Here follow the results of our research on magic, its essence and its connections to life and matter.

[...]
{what is meant that the soul breaths magic}
{how the will of the living affects magic}
{how magic interacts with matter}
{how magic interacts with space and time}

And so we have studied magic and learned how it is connected to us and we are connected to it. And we have been manipulating it for a long time. This is how.

Theoretically, all living beings can control magic. Every creature does, subconsiouly, to incorporate his dreams and desires to the world, and to be a part of it. To control it willingly, however, requires a powerful will. The greatest your willpower, the more magic you can absorb and control, but at a price. As discussed above, magic is the breath of the soul. To manipulate it, the magician must bend his very soul, and that requires tremendous willpower and damages the soul and its vessel, the body. Some very powerful spells can cause permanent damage. Small damage is healed quickly in the soul. As the soul breaths magic, the magic itself heals the soul (The damage and healing on the body is described elsewhere). The damage in the soul manifests as madness. It usually heals after a good night's sleep, and the first thing mages learn is how to deal with it. There are many ways, and a good mage will have at least 6 or 7 tricks. If, however, left untreated, it might accumulate, become permanent, and turn someone completely mad.
